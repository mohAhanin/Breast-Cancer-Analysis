3-32) </ br>

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: </ br>
 </ br>
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) </ br>
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) </ br>
c) perimeter </ br>
d) area </ br>
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) </ br>
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) </ br>
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) </ br>
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) </ br>
i) symmetry </ br>
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1) </ br>

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three </ br>
largest values) of these features were computed for each image, </ br>
resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field </ br>
13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.</ br>

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.</ br>
